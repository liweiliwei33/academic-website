abstract: In this article, we provide an overview of existing computation offloading modes, e.g. remote cloud service mode and ad-hoc cloudlet-assisted service mode, and propose an opportunistic computation offloading (OPPOCO) to enable a more energy-efficient and intelligent strategy for computation offloading. Moreover, the simulation by OPNET verifies that our proposal is available and practical to improve mobile usersâ€™ Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE).

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Multimodal emotion data sets, features extraction, fusion strategies are discussed.
