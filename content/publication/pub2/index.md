abstract: This paper reviews the development background and hot spots of the data-driven multimodal emotion information fusion. Considering the real-time mental health monitoring system, the current development of multimodal emotion data sets, the multimodal features extraction, including the EEG, speech, expression, text features, and multimodal fusion strategies and recognition methods are discussed and summarized in detail. The main objective of this work is to present a clear explanation of the scientific problems and future research directions in the multimodal information fusion for data-driven emotion recognition field.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Multimodal emotion data sets, features extraction, fusion strategies are discussed.
